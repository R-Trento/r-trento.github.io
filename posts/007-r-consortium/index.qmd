Today, March 28th, 2025, we are proud to announce that the R-Trento Users Group has been accepted by the [R-Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org){target="_blank"}. This means that we are now officially recognized as a community of R users and developers, and we will receive support from the R-Consortium for our activities.

We thank the R-Consortium for the financial support that will allow us to organize our first in-person meeting in the next months and to have our meeting announcements published on [![](https://help.meetup.com/hc/theming_assets/01HZH3ZAT7AR9TR620NM18CDKN){height=2em}](https://www.meetup.com/r-rrento-users-group/).
