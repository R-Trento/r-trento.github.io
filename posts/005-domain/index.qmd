  RTUG website has a new domain and a new contact email.
---

Starting from {{<meta date>}}, RTUG website has a new domain under the [University of Trento](https://unitn.it){target="_blank"} domain: `rtug.unitn.it`. So the group's homepage is now accessible as <https://rtug.unitn.it>.

Furthermore, there is a new contact email address: <mailto:rtug.group@unitn.it>

:::{.callout-note}
The old address <https://r-trento.github.io> will continue to work, automatically redirecting to the new domain name.
