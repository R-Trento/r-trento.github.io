## {{< bi camera >}} Post Mortem ðŸ˜œ

So `RTUG::25.1` is over, and it was a great success! We had a good turnout, with more than 20 participants, and the feedback was very positive. The presentations were well received, and the discussions were lively.

We would like to thank all the speakers for their contributions, and all the participants for their interest and enthusiasm. We hope to see you again at the next RTUG meeting, which will be held in the fall of 2025.
