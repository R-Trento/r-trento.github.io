It is now time for planning the next R-Trento Users Meeting, code `RTUG::25.2`. The event is loosely planned for late Fall 2025. Content and location are still to be defined, but we are looking for contributions from the community, i.e. **YOU!**

Details will be announced here and on our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/r-trento-users-group/).

Remember: RTUG meetings are open to contributions, in the form of:

* presentations
* workshops or hands-on sessions
* discussions on open topics
* request for help or collaboration on specific issues

Drop your proposals to <rtug.group@unitn.it>.
