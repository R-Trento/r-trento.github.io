We organize meetings, workshops, and seminars, we share news, and we publish posts and tutorials. We are open to collaborations and partnerships with other groups and organizations. \n\n**Meetings** are the core of our activities: we plan to have two to three meetings per year, with a mix of invited speakers, tutorials, and member presentations. Meetings can be a great opportunity for networking, learning, sharing experiences, and possibly finding new collaborations or solution providers.\n\nTo collaborate with RTUG, you can:\n\n- **Become a member**: contact [the group](mailto:rtug.group@unitn.it?subject=[RTUG] Becoming a member) and ask for instructions. Membership if free and open to anyone interested. **Please note** that, to simplify the management of members mailing list, we are currently accepting one member per institution/department/workgroup. \n- **Get to know us**: [join our meetings](meetings.html)\n- **Volunteer and advertise your R skills**: [contribute a post](posts.html)\n\n\n\n# {{< bi people >}} Next meeting\n\n:::{#meetings}\n:::\n\n\n# {{< bi megaphone >}} News\n\n:::{#news}\n:::\n\n\n# {{< fa brands bluesky >}} On Bluesky\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Last post:\n:::{#bluesky-box}\nLoading last post\n:::\n:::",
