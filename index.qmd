The R-Trento Users Group is a shared space for academics, scholars, students, and professionals living and working in Trentino and surrounding areas that are passionate about the [R language](https://r-project.org) and its suite of tools.

*The suggested pronunciation for RTUG is "Ar-TOO(g)", akin to the Italian "Artù".*
