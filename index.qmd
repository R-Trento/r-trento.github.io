The R-Trento Users Group is a shared space for academics, scholars, students, and professionals living and working in Trentino and surrounding areas that are passionate about the [R language](https://r-project.org) and its suite of tools.

*The suggested pronunciation for RTUG is "Ar-TOO(g)", akin to the Italian "Art√π".*

# {{< bi gear >}} How it works

RTUG is a **community-driven group**. We organize meetings, workshops, and seminars, we share news, and we publish posts and tutorials. We are open to collaborations and partnerships with other groups and organizations. 

**Meetings** are the core of our activities: we plan to have two to three meetings per year, with a mix of invited speakers, tutorials, and member presentations. Meetings can be a great opportunity for networking, learning, sharing experiences, and possibly finding new collaborations or solution providers.

To collaborate with RTUG, you can:

- **Become a member**: contact [the group](mailto:rtug.group@unitn.it?subject=[RTUG] Becoming a member) and ask for instructions. Membership if free and open to anyone interested. **Please note** that, to simplify the management of members mailing list, we are currently accepting one member per institution/department/workgroup. 
- **Get to know us**: [join our meetings](meetings.html)
- **Volunteer and advertise your R skills**: [contribute a post](posts.html)
